### Prior 2

2 questions:

1. N out of every M (default to 1000) Americans has done X before.
2. For the typical **man or boy**, **woman or girl** who has done X before, how frequently does **he/she** do X? (default to year)

31 items:

Category | Item |
---- | ----------|
Hobby | 1. Hikes |
| 2. Runs |
| 3. Plays the banjo |
| 4. Plays tennis |
| 5. Climbs mountains| |
Clothing | 6. Wears a suit |
| 7. Wears a bra |
| 8. Wears slacks |
| 9. Wears socks |
| 10. Wears a watch |
Work | 11. Writes novels |
| 12. Writes poems |
| 13. Sells things on eBay |
| 14. Sells companies |
| 15. Steals cars|
| 16. Steals chewing gum|
| 17. Volunteers for soup kitchens |
| 18. Volunteers for political campaigns |
Entertainment | 19. Goes to the movies |
| 20. Goes to the opera |
| 21. Watches professional football |
| 22. Watches space launches |
| 23. Listens to Pandora |
| 24. Listens to live music |
Food | 25. Eats peanut butter |
| 26. Eats caviar |
| 27. Drinks beer |
| 28. Drinks coffee |
| 29. Smokes cigarettes |
| 30. Smokes marijuana |
| 31. Does cocaine |


Results:

Overall quite good. Good variability.
Clothing is surprisingly homogeneous besides bra and suit (maybe "wears a hat" would have been slightly better than "wears a watch").

Women write poetry more frequently than men.

Default time window of 1 year might have interesting effects (e.g. on smoking, which if given the time window of a day, would be quite different)

Also, might include control trials (votes in every presidential election: 4 years)


### Friends and family (Prior 3)

27 items from Priors 2 (removed 4 activities that were illegal activities).

First stage, participants generate the names of 8 close friends or family members.
Names will be in a column of text boxes.

Then, one at a time, the action will come up, and 8 text boxes and drop down menus will appear next to it.
Participants rate the frequency with which the person does the action.

4/6/2017 Pilot
- Each subject does 15 out of 27 items
- Pilot should be about 20 responses for items
--> 50 subjects?
- 50 * 1.25 + 20% = $75

### Friends and family 2

Same as previous version.
Relax instructions about name generation (now, "friends, family, or people you know").

Add debrief question ("Did you actually list people you knew?")

Added more options to drop-down menu to match all intervals used in truth judgments experiment (added: "2 weeks", "2 months", "6 months", "2 years").

4/18/2017
- Each subject does 15 out of 27 items
- Should be about 25 responses for items
- 50 * 1.25 + 20% = $75

### Friends and family 3

Ask about past frequency.
The hypothesis is that for really low frequencies for common activities (e.g., "eating peanut butter" once a year), this frequency gets rounded to 0 when thinking about future rates, but when thinking about number of times in the past, it won't be rounded to 0.

4/22/2017
- Each subject does 15 out of 27 items
- Should be about 25 responses for items
- 50 * 1.25 + 20% = $75


## Truth judgments (S2 task)

### TJ1

Frequency levels in times / year --

Frequency level | Natural language version
---- | ------------------
0.01 | Once in a  life time
0.06 | 5 times in a life time
0.3 | 20 times in a life time
1 | Once a year
6 | Twice a year
12 | Once a month
24 | Twice a month / biweekly
52 | Once a week
104 | Twice a week / biweekly
260 | Work week (5 times a week)
365 | Once a day

Percentiles are based on log-normal distributions of frequency of people who have done the action at least once.

Item | 25% | 50% | 75%
---- | ------------------
1. Hikes | 1 | 4 | 13
2. Runs |  3 | 20 | 120
3. Smokes | 75 | 550 | 3042
4. Drives to work | 265 | 320 | 390
5. Bikes to work | 19 | 77 | 311
6. Vacations in Switzerland | 0.01 | 0.03 | 0.07
7. Eats granola for breakfast | 17 | 53 | 178
8. Plays computer games | 91 | 190 | 392
9. Writes novels | 0.06 | 0.3  | 1.8
10. Writes poems | 0.1 | 0.6 | 3.2
11. Drinks beer | 40 | 90 | 170
12. Steals cars | 0.007 | 0.05 | 0.4
13. Fails at things | 3.2 | 19.1 | 88.1

Translated into natural language:

Item | 25% | 50% | 75%
---- | ------------------
1. Hikes | Once a year | 4 times a year | Once a month
2. Runs |  3 times a year | Twice a month | Twice a week
3. Smokes | Once a week | Once a day | Ten times per day
4. Drives to work | 5 times per week | 6 times per week | 7 times per week
5. Bikes to work | Once or twice a month | Once or twice a week | 6 times per week
6. Vacations in Switzerland | Once in a life time | Twice in a life time | 6 times in a life time
7. Eats granola for breakfast | Once or twice a month | Once a week | 3 times a week
8. Plays computer games | Twice a week | 4 times a week | Once a day
9. Writes novels | 5 times in a life time | 20 times in a life time  | Twice a year
10. Writes poems | 7 times in a life time | Once every other year | Three times a year
11. Drinks beer | Once a week | Twice a week | 3 times a week
12. Steals cars | Once in a life time | Five times in a life time | Once every other year
13. Fails at things | 3 times a year | Once or twice a month | Once or twice a week

Thoughts:

*Vacations in Switzerland* and *eats granola for breakfast* may be refocus the contrast class to *other places to vacation* and *other things to eat for breakfast*.

*Items presented with both male and female characters, for each participant

Details

+ 37 items / participant.
+ Each item randomly assigned to a frequency level (one of the 4 above), though not all frequency levels were used for each item because *a priori* they seemed uninformative

Task took me 5m. Paying $0.55.

n = 150

cost = 150 * 0.55 = $82.5 + $16.5 = $99

### TJ3: Enabling and preventative conditions

01/13/16
Design: 21 of the 31 items from TJ2. Picked the frequency level that people that had the most intermediate responses (1 per item), in order to allow for the largest deviations from baselin.

Each participant saw each of the 21 items randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

1.  Baseline (same as TJ2)
2. Enabling -- extra sentence about the actor making a plan to do the action again in the future
3. Preventative -- extra sentence about how the actor is unable or unwilling to do the action again in the future

I expect preventative to have a larger effect than enabling because in some sense: "the proof is in the pudding" (talk is cheap, I want to wait until you do something before I say you do it). The preventative items were chosen to be very strong and in some cases -- horrific (losing limbs). It's not clear if some of my preventative items will have an effect because they are more about actors' intentions as opposed to their capabilities (some intensions, while good, are hard to follow through with).


I plan to collect approximately 50 participants of data for each item X condition.
Task took me 4m (with distractions). Paying $0.4.

n  = 50 x 3 conditions = 150

cost = 150 * 0.4 = 60 + 12 = 72

### Predictive 1 (paired with TJ3)


01/21/16

Materials: Same as TJ3.

Procedure: Same as TJ3.

Dependent measure: In the next [[time window]], how many times do you think B will do thing?

Prediction: Baseline should track the frequency level given in the stimulus. Preventative should decrease future frequency from the frequency level in the stimulus. Enabling should increase future frequency (relative to baseline).

From the TJ3 data, I would expect *enabling* to have less of an effect on future frequency than the *disabling* (everything relative to baseline).

I plan to collect approximately 40 participants worth of data for each item X condition.
Paying $0.40.

n  = 40 x 3 = 120.

cost = 120* 0.4 = 48 + 9.6 = 57.6

## Interpretation tasks (Listener)

Same items as TJ2.

"wears a bra", "wears a suit" appear with both men and women characters (though only one person subject)

4/24/2017
- Each subject does all 27 items.
- 25 * 1.00 + 20% = $30
